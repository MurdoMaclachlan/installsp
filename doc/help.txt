======================INSTALL SLACKPACKAGE========================

This is a program to make it easy to move a newly-built Slackware
package to your local repository and install it on your system.

Note that installsp must be run as root, as it installs the
packages system-wide via installpkg.

The basic format of a command looks like this:

    installsp [package name]

Optionally, you may pass a custom location to move the package to:

    installsp [package name] [location]

If no location is passed, installsp will default to the location
specificied by the value of $repository in the config file.

By default, installsp looks for your package in /tmp; this can be
changed by changing the value of $sploc in the config file. The
package name should always be passed as a file name only, ignoring
its parent directories, which should be specified in this config
value.

The config file can be found at:
    
    /usr/doc/installsp/config.sh

There are several arguments that can be passed to installsp for
information. They will cause it to exit without installing or
moving any packages, but will provide details about the program
itself.
