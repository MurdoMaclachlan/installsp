Usage:
    installsp [-hlv] -p package [-u library_to_upgrade] [-r repository]

This is a program to make it easy to install a newly-built Slackware package
and optionally move it to your local repository, if you have one. You can
also upgrade an existing library by passing its name.

Mandatory arguments:
    -p <package>        the name of the package file

Optional arguments (with values):
    -r <repository>     the location to move the package file to; if this is
                        not given, the default path specified in the config
                        file will be used
    -u <library>        the name of a library to upgrade using the new
                        package

Optional arguments (without values):
    -h                  display this help and exit
    -l                  display a short version of the license and exit
    -v                  display the version number and exit
